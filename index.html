          <h1>Task</h1>
          <p>A small company has ‘n’ employees. Each employee takes part in 3 projects. Their performance on each project is recorded in percentage and averaged.
            For example employee1 takes part in projectA, projectB and projectC. The performance of employee1 in projectA is 83%, in projectB is 93% and in project is 100%.. Finding the average of all the projects gives the overall performance of this employee1.
            Store each project’s data in an array separatey.
            Find the name of the employee whose performance is outstanding and produce the percentage.
            Also apply the following labels to each employee according to their overall performance.
            If the overall percentage is greater than or equal to 90%, then “eligible for increment”, else if it is greater than or equal to 70% and less than 90%, then “eligible to continue in project team”, otherwise “change designation”.
            Write an algorithm for the above scenario.
            Algorithm means writing step by step procedure to solve a problem
